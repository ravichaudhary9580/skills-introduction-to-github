# GitHub Tutorial Quick Start

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with the GitHub Skills tutorial in this repository.

## About This Tutorial

This is an interactive tutorial designed to teach you the basics of GitHub. The tutorial is structured in steps, and GitHub Actions will automatically guide you through each step.

## Current Tutorial Steps

According to the README.md, here are the steps in this tutorial:

### Step 1: Create a Branch
Learn about branches and create your first branch called `my-first-branch`.

**Key Concepts:**
- Branches allow parallel development
- The default branch is `main`
- Branches keep your work isolated and safe

### Step 2: Commit a File
Learn how to create and commit files to your branch.

**Key Concepts:**
- Commits are snapshots of your changes
- Each commit has a message describing what changed
- Commits build your project's history

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request
Learn how to propose changes through a pull request.

**Key Concepts:**
- Pull requests (PRs) propose changes from one branch to another
- PRs enable code review and discussion
- PRs show exactly what will change

### Step 4: Merge Your Pull Request
Learn how to merge approved changes into the main branch.

**Key Concepts:**
- Merging integrates changes from one branch into another
- After merging, the feature branch can be deleted
- The main branch stays up to date with new features

## How to Follow This Tutorial

1. **Read the README.md** - The main README file contains detailed instructions for the current step
2. **Follow the instructions** - Each step has specific actions to complete
3. **Wait for GitHub Actions** - After completing a step, GitHub Actions will automatically update the README with the next step (usually takes about 20 seconds)
4. **Repeat** - Continue through all steps until completion

## Tips for Success

### 🎯 Stay Focused
Complete one step at a time. Don't skip ahead!

### 🔄 Refresh Often
After completing a step, refresh the page to see if GitHub Actions has updated the README.

### 📖 Read Carefully
The instructions are clear and specific. Follow them exactly as written.

### 🐛 Troubleshooting
If something doesn't work:
1. Re-read the instructions
2. Check that you followed each step exactly
3. Wait a full 30 seconds and refresh
4. Check the Actions tab for workflow status

### 💡 Learn by Doing
This is a hands-on tutorial. You'll learn best by actually performing the actions rather than just reading about them.
